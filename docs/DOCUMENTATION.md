# Welcome to Kivixa

Welcome! Kivixa is a powerful digital notebook designed for freeform note-taking, sketching, and planning. This guide will walk you through all of its features, from basic navigation to advanced tools.

## 1. Installation

To install Kivixa, simply double-click the `.exe` installer file you downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions. Once finished, you can launch the application from your Desktop or Start Menu.

## 2. Getting Started: The Interface

The application is divided into three main areas:

1.  **Documents & Folders Panel (Left):** This is where you organize your work. You can create folders to group your documents and see a list of all documents within a selected folder.
2.  **Toolbar (Middle):** Your primary toolbox. This panel contains everything you need to interact with your documents, from drawing tools to page settings.
3.  **The Canvas (Right):** This is the main area where you will create your content. It's an infinite space for your notes, drawings, and images, dynamically loading content as you navigate.

## 3. Managing Your Documents & Folders

Kivixa helps you stay organized with a simple file-and-folder system.

*   **Creating a Folder:** Click the "New Folder" button in the top-left to create a new folder in your list.
*   **Creating a Document:** Select a folder and click the "New Document" button. A new, blank document will be created and opened on the canvas.
*   **Switching Documents:** Simply click on any document in the list to open it on the canvas.

## 4. The Canvas: Your Digital Notebook

### Navigating the Canvas

*   **Pan (Move):** Click and hold the **middle mouse button** and drag to move your view around the infinite canvas.
*   **Zoom:** Hold down the `Ctrl` key and scroll your mouse wheel up or down to zoom in or out.
*   **Infinite Scrolling:** Simply scroll your mouse wheel to move up and down your document. New pages can be added automatically or manually as you reach the end.
*   **Comfortable Offset:** Kivixa can learn your preferred writing offset per page and device, helping to avoid palm-edge collisions and providing a more comfortable writing experience.

### Working with Pages

The "Pages" section of the toolbar gives you full control over your document's structure.

*   **Page Flow Modes:** Choose how new pages are added:
    *   **Auto-Add on Write:** A new page is automatically added when you write or draw beyond the current page's bottom edge.
    *   **Swipe Up to Add:** You manually swipe up at the bottom of the page to add a new one.
    You can set a default mode for all new documents and override it for individual documents.
*   **Add Page at End:** Adds a new page to the very end of your document.
*   **Insert Page After:** Adds a new page immediately after the one your mouse is currently hovering over.
*   **Tear Page:** Removes the currently hovered-over page with a visual animation.
*   **Add Page with Template:** When adding a new page, you can now select from a variety of pre-defined templates.
*   **Page Customization:** Use the dropdown menus to set the **Size** (A4, Letter, etc.), **Type** (Blank, Lined, Grid, Dotted), and **Color** for new pages you create.

## 5. The Toolbar: Your Tools

### The Drawing Tools

*   **Pen:** The primary tool for writing and drawing.
    *   **Color, Thickness, Opacity:** Use the color picker and sliders in the "Pen Options" panel to customize your pen.
    *   **Style:** Choose from different styles like a consistent **Fine Liner** or a pressure-sensitive **Brush**.
*   **Eraser:** Removes content from the canvas. Use the slider to adjust its size.
*   **Laser Pointer:** A temporary red dot that follows your cursor. Perfect for presentations, it does not leave any permanent marks.

### The Geometry Tools

For precise drawings, use the Geometry tools. When a guide is active, select the **Pen** tool to draw along its edges.

*   **Ruler & Set Square:**
    1.  Select the **Ruler** or **Set Square** tool to place it on the canvas.
    2.  **Move:** Click and drag the body of the tool.
    3.  **Rotate:** Click and drag the round handle.
    4.  **Draw:** Select the **Pen** tool and draw along any edge to create a perfectly straight, snapped line.
*   **Compass:**
    1.  Select the **Compass** tool.
    2.  **Move:** Drag the center point.
    3.  **Set Radius:** Drag the outer handle.
    4.  **Draw an Arc:** With the **Pen** tool selected, click and drag along the compass's circumference to draw a perfect arc.
*   **Shapes (Rectangle, Circle, etc.):**
    1.  Click the **Shapes** button, then select a shape type (e.g., "Rect").
    2.  Click and drag on the canvas to draw the shape to your desired size.
    3.  Use the handles that appear to **resize** (corners) and **rotate** (top handle).
    4.  Click the **Commit Shape** button to make the shape a permanent part of your drawing.

### Working with Images

*   **Adding an Image:**
    *   **Option 1:** Click the **Add Image** button and select a file from your computer.
    *   **Option 2:** Drag an image file directly from your desktop onto the canvas.
*   **Manipulating Images:** Once an image is on the canvas, you can use its handles to resize and rotate it, just like a shape.
*   **Drawing on Top:** After you click **Commit Shape**, the image becomes part of the page, and you can freely draw or write directly on top of it with any tool.

## 6. Saving and Exporting

*   **Automatic Saving:** All your work is saved automatically to your local device! Kivixa's robust data layer ensures your latest changes are persistently stored without you ever having to worry about clicking a "Save" button.
*   **Exporting to PDF:**
    1.  Click the **Export to PDF** button in the toolbar.
    2.  Kivixa will generate a high-quality PDF of your entire document.
    3.  Your browser will prompt you to save the `document.pdf` file.

## 7. Tips for Efficient Note-Taking

*   Use the middle mouse button to pan your canvas. It's often faster than using the scrollbars.
*   Leverage the **Infinite Canvas** by seamlessly extending your notes beyond traditional page boundaries.
*   Experiment with **Page Flow Modes** to find the most comfortable way to add new pages as you write.
*   Explore the expanded **Templates** library to quickly set up pages with specific styles, grids, or layouts.
*   Place a **Ruler** or **Set Square** on your canvas to quickly create tables, charts, or diagrams with straight lines.
*   Drop images onto the canvas and use the **Pen** tool to annotate them directly for quick feedback or analysis.
*   Organize your projects into **Folders** to keep your workspace clean and your documents easy to find.

## 8. What's Next?

Kivixa is currently undergoing a major update to a modern Flutter-based UI. We have focused on building a robust and performant backend first to ensure a solid foundation. This documentation reflects the functionality of the backend. The next stage of development will focus on integrating these powerful features into a new, intuitive, and beautiful user interface. Stay tuned for updates!
