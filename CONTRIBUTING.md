## Coding Guidelines

### Dart Style Guide

* Follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
* Use `flutter analyze` to check for issues
* Use `dart format .` to format your code
* Maximum line length: 80 characters (flexible for readability)

### Code Quality

* Write clear, self-documenting code
* Add comments for complex logic
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Keep functions small and focused on a single task
* Avoid deeply nested code

### Testing

* Write tests for new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
* Aim for high test coverage
* Include both unit tests and widget tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
Add PDF annotation feature

Implement PDF viewer with annotation capabilities including:
- Pen tool for freehand drawing
- Text highlighting
- Shape drawing (rectangles, circles)

Fixes #123
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Database Layer
* Use repository pattern for database operations
* Keep all SQL queries in repository classes
* Use transactions for multi-step operations

### UI Layer
* Keep widgets focused and composable
* Extract reusable components into separate widget files
* Use StatefulWidget only when necessary
* Prefer immutable data structures

### Service Layer
* Business logic should be in service classes
* Services should be independent of UI
* Use dependency injection where appropriate

### State Management
* Document state management approach for your feature
* Keep state as local as possible
* Use appropriate state management solutions

## Documentation

* Update README.md if you change functionality
* Add doc comments to public APIs
* Update relevant documentation in the `docs/` folder
* Include examples for complex features

## Performance

* Profile your code for performance bottlenecks
* Use `const` constructors where possible
* Avoid unnecessary rebuilds
* Optimize images and assets
* Test on real devices, not just emulators

## Accessibility

* Ensure UI is accessible to all users
* Add semantic labels to interactive elements
* Support screen readers
* Test with accessibility tools

## Release Process

1. All changes must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
2. All tests must pass
3. Documentation must be updated
4. Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

## Getting Help

* Check the [documentation](docs/)
* Ask questions in GitHub Discussions
* Join our community chat (if available)

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
* The project README
* Release notes
* The contributors list
